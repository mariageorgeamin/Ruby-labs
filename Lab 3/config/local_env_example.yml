# Rename this file to local_env.yml
# Add account settings and API keys here.
# This file should be listed in .gitignore to keep your settings secret!
# Each entry gets set as a local environment variable.
# This file overrides ENV variables in the Unix shell.
# For example, setting:
# DATABASE_USERNAME: 'Your_Database_Username'
# DATABASE_PASSWORD: 'Your_Database_Password'
# makes 'Your_Database_Username' available as ENV["DATABASE_USERNAME"]
# makes 'Your_Database_Password' available as ENV["DATABASE_PASSWORD"]
DATABASE_USERNAME: Your_Database_Username
DATABASE_PASSWORD: Your_Database_Password
